    <h3 style="color:whitesmoke;">Data Cleanup</h3>
    <h6 style="color: white;">We started with data from the University of Alberta Computer Poker Research group that
        included three raw CSV files that included information on player's poker hands, winnings, actions during the
        various rounds of Texas Hold 'Em, chair position, table information as well as betting information. The tables
        were stored in a sqlite database and imported using SQLalchemy. After reviewing the data, we used Pandas and
        Python to reduce the number of attributes to 12
        (num_players, flop_pot, turn_pot, river_pot, chip_count, chair_num, player_bet, table_1, table_2, table_3,
        table_4, table_5, flop_players, turn_players, river_players) and used the "player_winnings"
        column as our target value. Columns containing numerical values were converted to numberical types. For the
        non-numerical values, the "get_dummies" feature was used to allow for the selection of cards on the table. Those
        columns were table1 - table5
        and represented the 5 cards that could be played throughout the round. This increased the number of columns from
        12 to 270. The "y"/"player_winnings" column was formatted to 0's for rows with no winning values and 1's for
        rows with winnings in order to create our targets.
        From there, we were able to move on creating the machine learning model.

    <h6 style="color:white;">Once the data had been cleaned, we moved on to the machine learning portion of the project
        which consisted of our instructor Nathan's three favorite steps: model, fit, predict. We used the Sci-Kit
        learning library to train/test/split the X dataframe, scale and fit
        the data using StandardScaler and scaler.transform, and finally define the deep learning model. Once the model ran through, we were able to determine it had 88%
        accuracy.
